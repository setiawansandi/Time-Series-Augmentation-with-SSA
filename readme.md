# Introduction

This project was created to allow for the augmentation of time-series dataset. Time series data are widely used in machine learning. They are commonly used for training model for prediction and classification, to name a few. However, there have been issue where there are relatively lack of time series data to train the model, which resulted in either underfitting or unable to improve generalisation.

"To remedy this, we use Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to seperate a signal into trends and cycles -to describe the shape of the signal- and low level components. In a novel way we subject the low level component to randomizing processes then recombine this with the original trend and cycle components to form a synthetic time series."
